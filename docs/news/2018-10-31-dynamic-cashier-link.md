# Dynamic Cashier Link Mapping

A new token is introduced that allows fetching of cashier link based on _Country_ and _Currency_

You can use this token for the cashier link mapping:

```
{cashier}
```

Configuration can be found here `admin/config/webcomposer/config/header` on the new _Cashier_ section

**PS:** Please do note that you still need to configure the _Cashier Link_ on the _Login_ tab with the token if you
plan to use the mapping
