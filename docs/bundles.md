# Bundles

Bundles are grouped functionality of features bundled in a single directory group.

Bundles can be used to share functionalities across multiple products.

## Directory Structure

```yaml
src/Bundles/
    Casino/
        assets/
            scripts/
                feature.js
        Controllers/
                MyController.php
        readme.md
```

You can define a namespace group in the **Bundles** folder where all your feature related files will be bundled.
